# Recipes

One page per job/task. Copy/paste blocks are always at the top.

- Start from the closest recipe
- Fill inputs
- Paste the Prompt into Codex
- Run the Commands locally

Taken together, Recipes + Prompt Library are a one-stop set of best practices: repeatable workflows, consistent structure, and strict quality gates.

Recommended order:

1) [Bootstrap a package for agentic work](bootstrap-a-package-for-agentic-work/)
2) [Fix a bug (regression test first)](fix-a-bug-with-regression-test/)
3) [Add a function (with tests + docs)](add-a-function/)
