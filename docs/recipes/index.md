# Recipes

One page per job/task. Copy/paste blocks are always at the top.

- Start from the closest recipe
- Fill inputs
- Paste the Prompt into Codex
- Run the Commands locally

Taken together, Recipes + Prompt Library are a one-stop set of best practices: repeatable workflows, consistent structure, and strict quality gates.
