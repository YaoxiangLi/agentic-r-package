# Agentic R Package Development

A copy/paste-first “cookbook + prompt library” for building R packages with strict quality gates:

- Implement in small patches
- Prove behavior with `testthat`
- Keep docs current with roxygen
- Use `devtools::check()` as the arbiter

## Use this like a tool

- Do the first loop: Start Here → one end-to-end iteration.
- Then live in Recipes + Prompt Library.
- When things break, jump to Troubleshooting.

## Sections

- [Start Here (60–90 min)](start-here/)
- [Recipes](recipes/)
- [Prompt Library](prompt-library/)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/)
- [Rigour Track](rigour-track/)
